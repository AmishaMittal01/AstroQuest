AstroQuest was developed as part of the 3rd Semester
Object-Oriented Programming (Java) Lab Mini Project.

Through this project, we learned to effectively apply
key OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance,
and polymorphism, while creating an engaging interface
using Java Swing. The process also enhanced our teamwork,
problem-solving, and software design skills — helping us
understand how to turn ideas into meaningful, interactive applications.
